# DSA_in_Cpp

This repository contains the code for the weekly lab assignments of the Data Structures and Algorithms course that I took at my university. The code is implemented in C++ and covers various topics such as arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and more.

## Folder Structure

Here's a list of the lab works included in this repository:

- [Lab 1: Practice Programming Fundamentals from my repo: ](./LAB%2001/) [PF_in_cpp](https://github.com/asadali27232/PF_in_cpp)
- [Lab 2: Arrays](./LAB%2002/)
- [Lab 3: Stack](./LAB%2003/)
- [Lab 4: Queue](./LAB%2004/)
- [Lab 5: Linked List](./LAB%2005/)
- [Lab 6: Linked List](./LAB%2006/)
- [Lab 7: Circular Linked List](./LAB%2007/)
- [Lab 8: Searching & Sorting](./LAB%2008/)
- [Lab 9: Binary Search Tree](./LAB%2009/)
- [Lab 10: Heap Tree](./LAB%2010/)
